  "hide" triangle bracket -- have this be a blog about my feelings of my inner mess monster--both brain and realm --- and write about it --- show it--- and then have a treasure chest hunt on the mess image where you find a specific item --- and you can get it --- it looks like a clothespin to click it -- and a bit of history of the item of clothing --- a good memory with it, how it fits, why I wanna burn it, did kids make it, the ethics, and urmonster -- for them to share their own stories with clothes
  "hide" to do this --- look up how to add pins to a picture + add a pop up layer, maybe a secret listener device, to have the image react to clicking in specific areas --- figure out how to block the image
  "hide" a link--- link to another website that talks about sustainability + a map or tools or tips 
  "hide" theme --- edgy, purple black, about the climate, clothes, messy brains, messy rooms, fuck mess, I'm basic bitch, now let's get clothed 
  "hide" count up timer --- shows how long its gonna take to clean my room 
  "hide" reaction to count down ending --- boom something midly embarassing will happen --- or opposite --- pop up: basic bitch
  "hide" when coding this --- think of a typewriter that is telling the story, and on certain pages images of my messy room appear
